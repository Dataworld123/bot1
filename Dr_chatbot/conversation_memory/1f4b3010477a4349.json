      "content": "Root canal therapy is a procedure designed to save a tooth that has become infected or damaged. At my practice, by Dr. Meenakshi Tomar, I ensure that my patients receive the best care during this process.\n\nHere's a detailed look at the root canal process:\n\n**Key Steps in Root Canal Therapy:**\n\n- **Initial Consultation and X-rays**:  \n  I take complete X-rays to assess the tooth and surrounding area.\n\n- **Anesthesia and Dental Dam**:  \n  A local anesthetic is administered to numb the area, and a dental dam is placed to keep the tooth dry.\n\n- **Access Opening**:  \n  I create a small opening in the tooth to access the pulp chamber.\n\n- **Pulp Removal**:  \n  Using small instruments, I carefully remove the infected or damaged pulp from inside the tooth.\n\n- **Cleaning and Shaping**:  \n  The empty space is cleaned and shaped to prepare for filling.\n\n- **Filling with Gutta-Percha**:  \n  I fill the cleaned space with gutta-percha, a biocompatible material, to seal the canals.\n\n- **Temporary Filling**:  \n  A temporary filling is placed to restore function until a permanent restoration can be made.\n\n- **Final Restoration**:  \n  In a follow-up visit, I place a permanent restoration or crown to complete the process.\n\n**Benefits of Root Canal Therapy:**\n\n- **Pain Relief**:  \n  Alleviates the discomfort caused by infection or damage.\n\n- **Tooth Preservation**:  \n  Saves the natural tooth, avoiding the need for extraction.\n\n- **Functionality**:  \n  Restores normal chewing function.\n\n**Recovery and Aftercare Tips:**\n\n- **Pain Management**:  \n  Over-the-counter pain relievers may be recommended following the procedure.\n\n- **Diet**:  \n  Stick to soft foods for a few days to avoid discomfort.\n\n- **Follow-Up Care**:  \n  Attend any scheduled follow-up appointments to ensure proper healing.\n\nIf you have any further questions or would like to schedule a consultation to discuss your specific case, I'm here to help! ðŸ¦· Would you like to set up a time to come in?",
